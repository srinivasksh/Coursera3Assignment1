Code Book
This code book contains information about the source data, the transformations performed after collecting data and information about the variables of the resulting data sets.

Study Design

The source data was collected from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to submit an assignment for a Coursera course named Getting and Cleaning Data instructed by Jeff Leek. The assignment involved working with the data set and producing tidy data representation of the source data. Below is a list of the operations done to achieve the outputs.

Downloaded the data sets provided
Unzipped the datasets (test and training) into my local directory
Loaded the data sets into data frames
Loaded source variable names for the two data sets
Loaded activity labels
Combined test and training data frames using rbind function
Paired the 2 data frames to only include the mean and standard deviation variables using grep
Replaced activity IDs with the activity labels for better readability
Combined the above two data frames to produce one data frame containing the subjects, measurements and activities
Created "merged_tidy_data.txt" with the combined data frame as the first expected output
Created another data set using data.table library to group the tidy data by subject and activity
Applied the mean and standard deviation calculations across the groups
Produced "calculated_tidy_data.txt" as the second expected output
run_analysis.R has more implementation details.

Variables

subjectId: 1 to 30 each representing a participant in the study
activity: the activity that the subject was doing at the time of the measurement
